#evilgooglesearch
####Sometimes, searching the internet isn't as easy as it seems.

#### LEVEL 1 TODO:
- Evil Search functionality:
	- Tab access keeps sliding away from search bar element
	- 'Search' button click from nav shelf doesn't work (how is TBD)
	- evil script prevents me from moving mouse onto search bar directly


#### LEVELS
Level 1: User must perform a Google search, but when user attempts to move mouse into box, an evil script bounces the mouse away.

If user tries to tab to the search box, evil script pushes the tab index elsewhere

Level 2: Huzzah!  User finally searched.  But now the DOM crumbles and falls to the bottom of the screen.
User must build a tower from the DOM pieces at least [x] high.
	- x = 600 pixels, or 12 DOM elements stacked on one another

### OTHER NOTES
